<h2>Uruuru – Multilingual Marketplace App for Foreign Residents in Japan</h2>

1. Overview

Uruuru is a multilingual marketplace app designed for foreign residents living in Japan.
The goal is to provide a simple, comfortable selling and buying experience in one’s own language, reducing common barriers such as:
	•	Japanese-only product descriptions
	•	Complicated address input formats
	•	SMS verification issues
	•	Lack of multilingual support

To solve these pain points, the app includes:
	•	Facebook Login
	•	Address auto-fill via ZipCloud API
	•	Full multilingual UI (English / Japanese / Sinhala)
	•	AI-assisted product description generation (OpenAI)

This app focuses on user-friendliness for non-Japanese speakers while maintaining production-level code quality.

2. Background

While living in Japan, I noticed that existing flea-market apps (Mercari, Rakuma, etc.) are difficult for many foreigners to use:
	•	Writing product descriptions in Japanese is challenging
	•	Postal address formatting is confusing
	•	Phone number requirements often prevent registration
	•	Interfaces rarely support English
	•	Listing flow differs from what many foreigners expect

To address these issues, I designed and developed a marketplace that foreign residents can actually use easily.
